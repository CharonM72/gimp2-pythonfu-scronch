# gimp2-pythonfu-scronch
A fairly simple GIMP 2.x Python-fu script that will export the full, flattened, current image as a .png with smart filenaming.


Intended to be set to a keyboard shortcut for quick and easy exporting.


ONLY WORKS IN GIMP 2.x - For a Gimp 3.0-compatible version, see https://github.com/CharonM72/gimp-pythonfu-scronch

Windows:

C:\Users\[yourname]\AppData\Roaming\GIMP\3.0\plug-ins

The script will be registered directly at the bottom of Filters.
